# Cambion.Serializer.JsonNet

Cambion is a lightweight distributed application framework with multiple and pluggable backends, providing a set of convenience functions for event handling.
This serializer for Cambion serializes data into `JSON` which is human readable and well suited for development environments, but robust enough to also be used in production environments. It uses [Newtonsoft Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) for the actual serialization.
